# Hierarchical-Clustering-using-R-and-Python
obtain optimum number of clusters. 

# Problem Statements:
 1.	Perform clustering for the airlines data to obtain optimum number of clusters. Draw the inferences from the clusters obtained. Refer to EastWestAirlines.xlsx dataset.

 2.	Perform clustering for the crime data and identify the number of clusters formed and draw inferences. Refer to crime_data.csv dataset.

 3.	Perform clustering analysis on the telecom data set. The data is a mixture of both categorical and numerical data. It consists of the number of customers who churn out. Derive     insights and get possible information on factors that may affect the churn decision. Refer to Telco_customer_churn.xlsx dataset.

 4.	Perform clustering on mixed data. Convert the categorical variables to numeric by using dummies or label encoding and perform normalization techniques. The data set consists       of details of customers related to their auto insurance. Refer to Autoinsurance.csv dataset.
